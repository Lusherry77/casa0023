# Policy

## Summary

The Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan (HAP) is the first comprehensive heat-health policy implemented in South Asia. Ahmedabad, a rapidly urbanising city in Gujarat, India, experienced a deadly heatwave in 2010 that led to over 1,300 excess deaths. In response, the city partnered with public health experts, meteorologists, and urban planners to launch a pioneering plan to reduce heat-related mortality and build long-term climate resilience (Knowlton et al., 2014).

The policy includes a multi-pronged strategy: early warning systems based on temperature forecasts, public education campaigns to increase heat risk awareness, training for medical professionals, and the establishment of “cooling spaces” such as temples and public buildings. One of its most important goals is to prioritise vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly, informal workers, and residents of low-income, high-density areas.

Ahmedabad’s urban form—high impervious surface cover, limited green space, and dense informal settlements—makes it particularly vulnerable to Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. While the HAP does not explicitly reference Earth Observation (EO) data, many of its components, like hotspot mapping and monitoring of intervention effectiveness, could benefit from remotely sensed inputs. The plan has since been adapted in several Indian cities, and it aligns closely with international goals like SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

I found it compelling that this policy treats extreme heat not only as a weather issue, but as a public health and equity concern. It shows how spatial data, urban planning, and healthcare can come together to respond to the complex challenge of climate-driven risks in cities.


## Applications

### Policy Challenge: Localised Heat Data Is Missing

A key policy gap in Ahmedabad’s Heat Action Plan is the lack of spatially detailed, real-time heat information. While the policy provides useful interventions—such as cooling centres and public alerts—it struggles to target the most vulnerable zones due to insufficient thermal mapping at the city scale. Without this, planners cannot prioritise where to act or evaluate whether the actions are effective.

### Solution: Using MODIS LST to Detect Urban Heat Patterns

MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) offers a valuable dataset to address this gap. With its near-daily temporal resolution and 1 km spatial coverage, MODIS enables continuous monitoring of urban heat islands (UHI). These data can be used to build heat vulnerability maps that combine temperature with population density, housing quality or informal settlement locations—helping target cooling centres or emergency services (Wellmann et al., 2020).
 
### Evaluation: Measuring the Impact of Cooling Policies

MODIS LST is also useful for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. For example, after installing green roofs or tree cover, the same dataset can be used to track whether the targeted neighbourhoods are actually cooling over time. This helps cities move toward evidence-based, adaptive planning (Gerasopoulos et al., 2022). 

### Broader Value: Affordable, Scalable, Policy-Aligned

Unlike ground monitoring networks, which are costly and sparse, MODIS provides open-access, globally consistent data—making urban heat tracking feasible even in resource-limited cities. This approach doesn’t replace local knowledge but enhances it. By integrating such data, Ahmedabad’s HAP contributes to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action) while building a more inclusive and data-driven governance system (Li et al., 2022).


## Reflection

I’ve always known that extreme heat can be dangerous, especially in cities with poor housing conditions and limited access to cooling. But what I hadn’t thought about was how remote sensing could actually be part of the policy toolkit to deal with that risk. This week’s example from Ahmedabad gave me a more grounded understanding of how data, planning, and public health can intersect. It wasn’t the technology that surprised me, but the simplicity and pragmatism of the policy—mapping who’s most at risk, warning people early, and opening cool spaces in temples or schools. Somehow it felt both low-tech and deeply data-informed at the same time.

Ahmedabad’s approach, while simple in some ways, actually pushes the boundaries of both local and global governance. It translates climate data into neighbourhood-scale action, prioritises vulnerable populations, and connects meteorological forecasting to public health infrastructure. By integrating MODIS temperature data, the policy could evolve into a more responsive and spatially precise system. This directly supports SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 3 (Health and Well-being), by linking environmental monitoring with urban resilience and social equity.

Working with the data made me more aware of how much policy depends on interpretation. A satellite image doesn’t mean anything until someone asks: what should we do about this? It also reminded me that the barrier is not just technology, but capacity—having people, skills, and systems in place to act on data. For me, the most valuable lesson was seeing how something as technical as thermal imagery can contribute to decisions that affect real lives. That feels both exciting and humbling.
