# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hi there~

I’m Yidian, a postgraduate student in the CASA MSc Urban Spatial Science programme, with an undergraduate background in Landscape Architecture.

I’ve always been interested in how spatial environments shape daily life, especially in the context of urban inequality and climate resilience. This module marks my first in-depth journey into remote sensing. Rather than just picking up technical tools, I hope to explore how satellite data can meaningfully contribute to urban planning, policy, and spatial justice, bridging data and real-world impact.
